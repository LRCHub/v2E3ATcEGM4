[00:01.05] Yeah, yeah
[00:06.05] 
[00:03.49] The world is so small 'til it ain't, yeah
[00:10.13] I'm building up a wall 'til it break
[00:16.47] She hate it when I call and it's late
[00:20.96] I don't wanna keep you waitin'
[00:24.05] I hope I never keep you waitin', yeah
[00:42.55] 
[00:29.03] I think I know it all but I don't
[00:35.25] Why you always at the mall when you broke? Yeah
[00:41.64] And I just wanna ball
[00:43.70] Maybe dunk but I've never been tall, yeah
[00:47.66] I might trip, I never fall
[00:49.47] God knows I came close (don't try this at home)
[01:12.97] 
[00:52.31] I know I probably need to do better, fuck whoever
[00:55.48] Keep my shit together
[00:56.95] You never told me being rich was so lonely
[00:59.91] Nobody know me, oh well
[01:02.53] Hard to complain from this five-star hotel
[01:05.21] I'm always in a rush
[01:06.77] I've been thinking too much but
[01:08.69] Keep it on the hush, no one need to know, just us
[01:11.69] That's really all it takes
[01:14.19] We don't need nothing but today (day), today (day)
[01:17.22] Today (day), today (day)
[01:29.22] 
[01:19.34] The world is so small 'til it ain't
[01:22.58] ('Til it ain't, 'til it ain't, 'til it ain't)
[01:26.05] I'm building up a wall 'til it break
[01:28.94] ('Til it break, 'til it break, 'til it break)
[01:32.10] She hate it when I call and it's late
[01:35.19] (And it's late, and it's late)
[01:36.82] I don't wanna keep you waitin' (I don't wanna keep you waitin')
[01:39.78] I hope I never keep you waitin' (I hope I never keep you waitin')
[02:12.28] 
[01:44.65] Woo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[01:47.92] Woo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[01:51.21] Woo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[01:54.32] Woo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[01:57.29] Woo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[02:00.77] Woo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[02:03.85] Woo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[02:06.94] Woo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[02:29.94] 
[02:08.31] Yeah, got a bad attitude, playin' 'til I'm out of moves
[02:12.75] No need for shame, I get more peace at slow speeds
[02:16.00] Go beat the game, young control freak
[02:18.08] It's cold in my veins, I'm below freezing
[02:20.56] Snow season (made me)
[02:31.06] 
[02:22.58] They know that I so need my space
[02:25.04] Don't wanna grow old, so I smoke just in case
[02:28.98] She say that I glow below the waist
[02:31.32] And a stroke is just so PGA
[02:34.05] All I got is a little bit of space and time
[02:37.56] Drawing shapes and lines of the world we made
[03:00.06] 
[02:41.71] Tomorrow may be right around the corner
[02:43.85] But I swear it's gon' be worth it if I make you wait
[02:47.65] There's somewhere above, you keep reaching up
[02:52.53] That's really all it takes (that's really all it takes)
[02:55.68] We don't need nothing but today (day), today (day)
[02:58.34] Today (day), today (day)
[03:10.34] 
[03:00.59] The world is so small 'til it ain't
[03:03.62] ('Til it ain't, 'til it ain't, 'til it ain't)
[03:06.74] I'm building up a wall 'til it break
[03:09.78] ('Til it break, 'til it break, 'til it break)
[03:12.95] She hate it when I call and it's late
[03:16.13] (And it's late, and it's late)
[03:17.93] I don't wanna keep you waitin' (I don't wanna keep you waitin')
[03:20.88] I hope I never keep you waitin'
[03:36.38] 
[03:37.25] Yeah, nine times out of ten, I get it wrong
[03:41.05] That's why I wrote this song, told myself to hold on
[03:45.17] I can feel my fingers slippin'
[03:46.82] In a motherfuckin' instant, I'll be gone
[03:49.31] Do you want it all if it's all mediocre?
[03:52.11] Starin' at the wall and the wall's full of posters
[03:55.24] Lookin' at my dreams, who I wanna be
[03:58.86] I guess you gotta see it to believe
[04:16.36] 
[04:01.32] Ooh, I been a fool but that's cool
[04:03.32] That's what human beings do
[04:04.83] Keep your eyes to the sky, never glued to your shoes
[04:08.11] Guess there was a time when my mind was consumed
[04:10.97] But the sun comin' out now, clouds start to move
[04:15.32] Don't tell me nothin' but the truth
[04:17.93] I'm tired, I don't gotta spare a second
[04:21.53] Win or lose, win or lose
[04:23.48] I don't keep count, nobody checking
